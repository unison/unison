Let's migrate options to the following standard:

options:
Unison::DBI opts: -d, -U, -h

-q pseq_id      -Q pset_id
-m pmodel_id    -M pmodelset_id (pmodelset name?)
-o porigin_id (or name?)
-p params_id

--pseq_ids-from-file
--force -- run despite run_history
--delete -- delete existing row first

The basic rationale is that "things" are lowercase, SETS of things are
uppercase. 

Where possible, CGI args should have the same names and semantics as the
command line args above.
