The papseq loading needs attention. There are several current problems:

1) differential updates is not supported
I intended to implement this as follows:

At time 1, query set Q1 is run against blast db sequences M1 (treated as
Models).  See section A below.

At time 2, query set (Q2-Q1) would be run against M2 ("B"), and set (M2-M1)
would be run against Q1 ("C").

	       -------- M2 ------
	            M1        
	      +-------------+----+
	  |   |AAAAAAAAAAAAA|CCCC|
	  |   |AAAAAAAAAAAAA|CCCC|
	  | Q1|AAAAAAAAAAAAA|CCCC|
	 Q2   |AAAAAAAAAAAAA|CCCC|
	  |   +-------------+----+
	  |   |BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB|
	      +-------------+----+

This is only an approximation, since technically the statistics depend on
the database, which is changing between time 1 and time 2. This can be
largely ignored for such a large database and with the use of the blast -z
option.

If we assume that M1=Qi, then it suffices to just run Qi against Mi at
time 2, effectively rolling "B" and "C" into the same run.


2) The current layout through pmpseq in order to achieve the model-level
abstraction for sequences is not worth the join cost or the programming
effort.
