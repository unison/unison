unison/loading/aux/ README
==========================

Unison depends on a variety of third-party data such as PDB, SCOP, etc.
Each of these dependencies is represented by a subdirectory which contains
code to download, parse, and build a database representation of that data.

Our intention is only to represent these data in a way which permits
access within the Unison environment. We do not modify these data in any
way during loading.

Currently, only Unison uses these schemas. However, some users may find
them useful by themselves (for instance, the PDB seqres-to-resid mapping).
