This directory contains utilities to implement a taxonomy schema based on
NCBI taxonomy and the SwissProt species list.

The grand unified schema (schema.sql, schema2.sql, and init.sql) are
close, but incomplete.  

As a stop gap to get tax info in csb pronto, I'm currently using only
swiss-prot.  See ./sp-schema.sql and ./bin/sp-import.
