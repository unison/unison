* paths:
The perl API is checked out in /apps/compbio/lib/perl5/site_perl/Unison .
The web path is /usr/local/apache2/htdocs-* .
The web pages use a web-only perl5 directory (see Unison/WWW.pm) if it
exists.  Reece usually makes this a symlink to his Unison perl5 dev tree
for web development, and uses the /apps/compbio/ perl default for
production.


in csb-dev:
- schema changes are made and tested
- data may be loaded (but may be dropped at will if csb-dev needs to be reverted)

DS: development-to-staging process
- csb-dev is RENAMEd to csb-stage

in csb-stage:
- schema frozen
- data may be loaded; lost only if csb-stage is rejected for serious schema issues
- API, command line tools, and web interface is tested

SP: staging-to-production process
- csb-stage is renamed to csb
- csb-dev is recreated from csb
- all insert, delete, and update privileges are dropped from tables in
unison schema (user schemas remain writable)

in csb:
- schema and data are frozen
- access to unison schema tables are read-only

PD: production-to-development
- csb is copied to development so that dev begins on current prod database
