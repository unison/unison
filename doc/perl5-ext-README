perl5-ext README

Unison requires many perl modules, all available from CPAN
(http://www.cpan.org/).  There are several ways to install perl modules.
In order of increasing difficulty:

- Install modules that may be available with your operating system
  distribution. This usually requires root/administrative privileges.

- Compile modules and install into system paths (i.e,. those listed in
  perl V). This usually requires root/administrative privileges.  Use CPAN
  for this.

- Install modules into non-standard locations (i.e., not listed in perl V)
  and set PERL5LIB appropriately.  CPAN will likely work here.

- Install into the perl5-ext directory in the Unison tree.  The perl5-ext
  directory is automatically searched for modules.  The advantage is that
  Unison looks here by default.  CPAN makes this very difficult.  Also
  consider installing into a non-standard location such as a home directly
  and symlinking (on Unix-ish boxes) perl5-ext to that location.

A mixture of these methods is possible.  Regardless of where the modules
are installed, Unison requires the following:
