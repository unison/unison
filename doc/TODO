* standardize function names
We have a lot of useful functions, but they're hard to find. We should
think (again) about standardization. Example: we have both pseq_locus_rep
and representative_pseq_id that do essentially the same thing. I (Reece)
haven't a clue why I made both, but I suspect forgetfulness.

* genome tab
rename Analysis to Protein to make way for non-protein analyses?
* integrate help, etc.
- get web table col descriptions from database col comments

* HTML Table  and SQL Table modules, w/ col sorting, etc.

* rethink site and page design
- pseq_ pages always have pseq_id entry field?
- what should pseq_summary do if pseq_id is missing?
- top level entry point
- ideally, we should move to a framework like Catalyst with mochikit

* popups and redisplay
- consider automatic submit for redisplay when user selects from popup

* sequence selection
- several command line tools reimplement ways to select sequences by 1)
  pseq_id, 2) fasta input, 3) gi annotation, 4) alias, etc.  This
  functionality should be consolidated, including standardizing any
  command line options.

* overhaul view structure
- need better mat view scheme (contrib package?)
- modularize and simplify -- we have too many views
- When a _mv exists, we should probably build it from a _dv (rename the
  existing _v to _dv) and use _v as a shallow wrapper for the _mv. That
  way, existing tools that use _dv will get the _mv instead of the slower
  dynamic view.


* assume limited search path
- e.g., ( unison ), definitely not user
- schema-qualify all tables and views
- provide option which add user tables

- see FIXME and BUG tags

- `make update' should work for all loading/ subdirs

- release tag in database

- perl5-prereq download/install/something

- require web release = API release = db release?

- --libraries -- Unison::options or somesuch dumps %INC for Unison modules
==> TODO <==
browse views
- excel export
- split cv def into sql and order by

select 
	pseq_locus,
	best_alias,
	descr,
	added,
	unq, pro, fam
	Y.*
FROM 
	(
	SELECT 
		[distinct on (locus_rep)],
	    locus rep,
		X.*
	FROM (select * from def) X
	[ORDER BY] locus_rep
	) Y
ORDER BY cvorder


* db restore script
- helper script to set search path, analyze, etc

* web deploy script
mkdir -p /local/usr-local/opt/unison/current/www/tmp
chmod 777

* loci show extremely slow

* need better way to test

* jmol 11 support
