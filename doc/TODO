# -*-outline-*-

* Genome tab
rename Analysis to Protein?

* integrate help, etc.

* Unison perl5 embedded in directory hierarchy? where?
+ makes web tree immune to Unison:: module changes outside of tree

* HTML Table  and SQL Table modules, w/ col sorting, etc.

* rethink site and page design
- pseq_ pages always have pseq_id entry field?
- what should pseq_summary do if pseq_id is missing?
- top level entry point

* popups and redisplay
consider automatic submit for redisplay when user selects from popup

* assume limited search path
- e.g., ( unison ), definitely not user
- schema-qualify all tables and views
- provide option which add user tables

- see FIXME and BUG tags

- `make update' should work for all loading/ subdirs

- release tag in database

- perl5-prereq download/install/something

- require web release = API release = db release?

- --libraries -- Unison::options or somesuch dumps %INC for Unison modules
==> TODO <==
browse views
- excel export
- split cv def into sql and order by

select 
	pseq_locus,
	best_alias,
	descr,
	added,
	unq, pro, fam
	Y.*
FROM 
	(
	SELECT 
		[distinct on (locus_rep)],
	    locus rep,
		X.*
	FROM (select * from def) X
	[ORDER BY] locus_rep
	) Y
ORDER BY cvorder
