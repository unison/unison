* Genome tab
rename Analysis to Protein?

* integrate help, etc.

* Unison perl5 embedded in directory hierarchy? where?
+ makes web tree immune to Unison:: module changes outside of tree

* HTML Table  and SQL Table modules, w/ col sorting, etc.

* rethink site and page design
- pseq_ pages always have pseq_id entry field?
- what should pseq_summary do if pseq_id is missing?
- top level entry point

* popups and redisplay
consider automatic submit for redisplay when user selects from popup

* assume limited search path
- e.g., ( unison ), definitely not user
- schema-qualify all tables and views
- provide option which add user tables
