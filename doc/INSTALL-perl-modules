install documentation for perl modules
2010-02-09 16:57 Reece Hart <reece@harts.net>

In typical Perl fashion, there's more than one way and one place to
install perl modules.  This documentation is intended to provide one of
the many right ways to live in peace with Perl modules.

Among the many problems is that the interdependent tools, modules, and
meta data are stored in multiple places.  For example, the 'cpan' command
line tool typically exists (at least) at /usr/bin/cpan.  If you install
CPAN as an unprivileged user, the cpan command and its modules will be
placed in non-system locations (e.g., ~/perl5/); invoking them properly
demands setting PATH and PERL5LIB correctly, and having a suitable config
file in ~/.cpan/.  It's easy to get this horribly and subtly wrong.  To
make matters worse, Perl is enduring a drawn-out and mind-numbing
evolution from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Build, which by default use
incompatible module trees.

The general scheme will be to create a directory root for a set of perl
modules.  You may have more than one such root.  The root contains enough
meta information to build a consistent tree.  In particular, we'll put the
CPAN config directory, which is typically in the user's home directory,
into this root.




* first time
me$ PMROOT=/h/lab/opt/perl-modules
me$ mkdir -p $PMROOT
me$ env - HOME=$PMROOT TERM=$TERM PATH=$PMROOT/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin PERL5LIB=$PMROOT/lib/perl5 cpan
(init with defaults)
cpan> o conf init urllist
cpan> o conf makepl_arg INSTALL_BASE=$HOME
cpan> o conf mbuildpl_arg --install_base=$HOME
cpan> o conf prefer_installer MB
cpan> o conf commit
cpan> install CPAN

* future installs
me$ env - HOME=$PMROOT PATH=$PMROOT/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin cpan
cpan>


eg$ PERL5LIB=<PERL_PREFIX>/lib/perl5 <PERL_PREFIX>/bin/cpan
(add'l config needed; defaults for now)
cpan> install YAML
cpan> install Digest::SHA
cpan> install ExtUtils::MakeMaker
cpan> install Module::Build
cpan> o conf prefer_installer MB
cpan> o conf commit
cpan> install <required modules. See below.>



eg$ mkdir -p $PMROOT/.cpan/sources 
eg$ wget http://www.cpan.org/MIRRORED.BY -O $PMROOT/.cpan/sources/MIRRORED.BY

eg$ cpan
cpan> o conf makepl_arg "PREFIX=<PERL_PREFIX> INSTALLDIRS=perl"
cpan> install CPAN
cpan> quit



NOTE: You may have latent dependencies on shared objects from the deprecated installation (eg, Perl DBD::Pg). 
cpan> force install DBD::Pg
(Force is needed because CPAN may think that the module is already installed, but it's linked against an older libpq.)
