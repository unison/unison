- nph-pdb-fetch.sh
Jmol can't fetch structures at URLs which require
authentication. Therefore, if you're using authentication in the Unison
cgi directory and you want to view structures, you'll need to copy
cgi/nph-pdb-fetch.sh to your /cgi-bin/ directory, which must be accessible
without authentication. unison/perl/Unison/Jmol.pm will detect
authentication automatically and use ../cgi/nph-pdb-fetch.sh or
/cgi-bin/nph-pdb-fetch.sh as appropriate.
