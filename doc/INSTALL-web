- nph-pdb-fetch.sh
Jmol can't fetch structures at URLs which require authentication.
Therefore, if you're using authentication in the cgi/ directory
and you want to view structures, you'll need to copy
cgi/nph-pdb-fetch.sh to your /cgi-bin/ directory, which must be
accessible without authentication.  unison/perl/Unison/Jmol.pm will
detect authentication automatically and use
../cgi/nph-pdb-fetch.sh or /cgi-bin/nph-pdb-fetch.sh as
appropriate.
