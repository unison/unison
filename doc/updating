Unison Update Tasks				-*-outline-*-



* Data:

** load sequences (SPDI, nr, incyte, ensemble, swiss-prot)

** load go, build gong

** load Prospect2 models

** load new scop
scop2pmodel 

** load HMMs (in-house, Pfam)
- In addition to loading Pfam, one must also make a new params set for
  each Pfam because the E-values depend on the number of models.

** load PSSMs (Proceryon, CDD)

** load genome assemblies

** load regexps



* Data derived in Unison (e.g., by plpgsql code):

** infer_tax_id
See sbin/update_tax_ids.

** update sets
select update_uni_sets;

** update stats



* Precomputed results
Typically, results are only precomputed for the uni_hmr set, which are
intended to be high-quality sequences from human, mouse, and rat.
Currently, there is no single script which runs new sequences.

** run-paprospect2

** run-pahmm

** run-papssm

** run-blat

** pairwise blast

** run regexps




* Other:

** generate blast database files
see sbin/dump-seqdb

** generate schema docs

** best_alias
truncate & update from dv_best_alias
