issues / todo:

IMPORTANT:

* sequence representatives
  Currently, all sequences in pseq are equal.  In reality, sequences may
  be usefully related by: 1) subsequences, 2) alternative splicing, 3)
  paralogs, 4) orthologs, 5) homology (not 3 or 4), and probably others as
  well.  Ex: given a good thread to pseq_id 333, how does one determine that
  333 is really a sigcleave'd fragment of 222 (case 1 above).

* delete from palias rule
  wipes out corresponding paliasorigin & pseqalias rows
  (or, just set not current?)



BACKBURNER:

* sequences may be "anonymous", meaning not referenced by any alias
  do we care?

* It's currently hard to tell which analyses have been run on some sequences.
  For analyses which may legitimately have no return value (e.g., tmdetect
  returns no S, N, or M region), it's impossible to distinguish sequences
  for which the analysis returned nothing from those which haven't yet been run.

* add current_user to pseq, palias tables

* order in asset aggregate




DONE
* sequence insertion too slow   DONE
  pseq_si_pseq_id too slow... (len,md5) instead of (md5,len)?
  problem: md5 was indexed but not 'analyzed', so md5 lookups were sluggish
  
* `model' table  DONE
  hmm, p2template, sbprofile (for structure-based p.), etc are all models
  they should inherit from a general models table which contains links
  to GO, etc.
  drag: migrate current p2template to inherited version of p2template 

* hmm, pfhmm tables  DONE
  hmm and features based on hmms

* species  DONE
  add tax table from NCBL (~rkh/tax/).  I'd like to see this as an
  ontology too, but I can't find any reference to such.  Propose to GO?

* pftype2pftype_id( ) lookup function  DONE

* Gene Ontology
  link models and sequences to GO, with interpro2go, spkw2go

* p2thread -> pfp2thread
  rename for conformity (pfeatures have prefix pf)
