Unison is a database of precomputed predictions on a comprehensive,
non-redundant set of protein sequences from numerous sources.  It excels
at holistic, feature-based mining (i.e., given diverse features, identify
matching sequences), but it is also well-suited to sequence analysis
(given a sequence, show features).  The database design enables rapid,
incremental updates of new sequences and new features.  Unison includes a
set of command line and web tools for data loading, manipulation, and
updating.  Source code and other content are released under the Apache
