This is CBT -- a computational biology toolkit
Copyright 1995-1998 Reece Hart


The goal of CBT is to provide common compuational biology (and,
eventually, compuational chemistry) facilities in a perl interface.

CBT was originally created by Reece Hart while a graduate student at
Washington University, subsequently overhauled in the Computational
Biology Center at IBM's TJ Watson Research Center, and gutted in 2003 at
Genentech.  The code was originally freely distributed.
