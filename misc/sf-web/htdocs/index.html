<h3>UNISON IN A NUTSHELL</h3>

Unison is a database of non-redundant protein sequences and extensive
precomputed predictions for those sequences.  Unison's primary goal is to
facilitate feature-based mining of sequence data (i.e., given features, show
sequences) for therapeutic target discovery.  Unison enables computational biologists to pose complex queries 
based on diverse features more efficiently, more completely, more reliably, and
more often, and to enable queries which were previously impractical.   Of
course, this same data may also be used for sequence analysis (i.e., given a
sequence, show features).

<p>The Unison SourceForge site provides the Unison schema, a perl API,
command line tools for loading and accessing data, a web interface, and a
SQL database dump of non-proprietary sequences and non-proprietary precomputed data.

<p>Unison is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/afl-2.1.php">Academic Free License v2.1</a>.


<h3>WHAT'S IN UNISON?</h3>
The Unison database consists of serveral schemas: "unison", which
contains the sequences and precomputed data described above, and independent
schemas for auxiliary databases which are incorporated from other
groups.  The auxiliary databases provide critical resources for the
annotation of sequences and interpretation of precomputed data.  These
auxiliary databases include:
<ul>
  <li>NCBI Taxonomy
  <li>NCBI HomoloGene
  <li>GO<i>ng</i>, our simplified Gene Ontology schema ("ng" is "next
  generation", with a nod to the trekkies among us)
  <li>PDB (summary data, but includes seqres-to-resid mappings akin to those is
  Astral for all chains)
  <li>SCOP
  <li>MINT
</ul>
(Full credits and references for these and the precomputed data methods are
included in the source code.)

<h3>WHAT CAN I DO WITH UNISON?</h3>
<dl>
  <dt><b>Build a reliable and easily updatable database of sequences and precomputed results.</b>
  <dd>At Unison's core is the infrastructure necessary to cull sequences from
  many sources into a non-redundant (by exact identity) set of sequences and
  annotations (accession, taxonomy, description) for those sequences from the
  source databases.  Database triggers
  guarantee non redundancy and immutable sequences, which in turn guarantees
  that precomputed results on a sequence are always valid.  Updating sequences
  is trivial and fast, and Unison automatically versions accessions whose underlying
  sequence change between releases of a source database.  Unison provides
  analysis "bookkeeping", which enables administrators to provide fast
  incremental updates of precomputed results and users to verify which analyses
  have been performed.  It's all conceptually
  simple, but practically challenging to make efficient and robust.

  <dt><b>Answer complex, integrative queries efficiently.</b>
  <dd>Because
  precomputed results and auxiliary data are integrated within one
  resource, it is possible construct holistic queries which span multiple
  types and sources of data. For example, one may:
  <ul>
  <li>identify distinct human sequences
  which contain an extracellular immunoglobulin (ig) domain by Pfam,
  followed by a transmembrane region, followed by an Immunoreceptor
  Tyrosine Inhibitory Motif (ITIM), and which have a mouse or rat ortholog 
  which meet the same criteria.
  <li>tabulate sequence- or structurally-aligned residues in kinases which have PDB structures complexed
  with small-molecule inhibitors
  <li>create views which embody the logic for repeated mining exercises
  </ul>
  

  <dt><b>Generate <i>in silico</i> hypotheses.</b>
  <dd>Precomputed results also enable rapid responses to "what-if?"
  questions and the formulation of new hypotheses. For example: What
  Pfam domains occur upstream of a transmembrane domain and an ITIM?


  <dt><b>Analyze protein structure models.</b>
  <dd>Unison provides comprehensive sequence-sequence, sequence-profile,
  sequence-structure, and structure-structure alignments. These provide
  mechanisms to, for example, explore the structural effects of sequence
  variants (even on modeled structures) and to study the sequence
  divergence among structurally related proteins. <!--[SNP EXAMPLE]-->

<h3>HOW DO I GET STARTED?</h3>

The Unison schema, source code, web pages, and non-proprietary data are
released under the Academic Free License.  You may download all of these
from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/unison-db/">Unison
SourceForge project pages</a>.  A demo site of the non-proprietary data is
being established -- please check back in August.
