Unison is a database of precomputed predictions on a non-redundant set of
protein sequences. The intent is to provided a centralized repository of
proteomic data which may be readily updated and which enables holistic
queries across all data.

Unison is three things: a database of precomputed results, a set of tools
built on this database, and a web interface to the database.  All of these
are released under the Academic Free License v. 2.1 and are available on
SourceForge at http://unison-db.sourceforge.net/ .
