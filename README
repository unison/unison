Unison is a database of precomputed predictions on a comprehensive,
non-redundant set of protein sequences from numerous sources.  It excels
at holistic, feature-based mining (i.e., given diverse features, identify
matching sequences), but it is also well-suited to sequence analysis
(given a sequence, show features).  The database design enables rapid,
incremental updates of new sequences and new features.  Unison includes a
set of command line and web tools for data loading, manipulation, and
updating.  All of these are released under the Academic Free License
v. 2.1 and are available on at http://unison-db.org/ .
