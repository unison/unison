This directory contains source code for Unison, a database of protein
prediction results for mining.  These are the goals:

immediately:
  - a non-redundant protein database with references to
    the (perhaps multiple) origins of each sequence
  - sets of protein sequences, possibly overlapping
  - prospect2 threading results, including separation
	of those obtained with various runtime options
  - miscellaneous sequence features, including sigpeptide, 
   	transmembrane, gpi, pI, scores

eventually:
  - sequence-sequence relationships
  - other method results, including Pfam,
    Interpro, Proceryon, BLAST/PSI-BLAST
  - annotations linked to results (i.e., /interpretations/
	of results) with qualities, to a small set
    of normalized domains (e.g., GO categories)

The current implementation is a compromise between the design that I
wanted and the design that I could actually implement in reasonable time.
Expect flux.  For example, annotations should really be handled
equivalently as localized sequence features (i.e., with start/stop) than
as full-length sequence annotations.

The database was designed using PostgreSQL (www.us.postgresql.org).
PostgreSQL was chosen because I wanted the database accissible inside and
outside the cluster; doing so with Oracle is impossible in the current
setup and onerous in any case.
