<h2>Connecting with psql</h2>

<p>psql is the PostgreSQL interactive terminal client, a command-line based
interface to PostgreSQL databases.  Although many users will deem psql to be
the most rudimentary interface, it is a terrific way to browse the Unison
schema and experiment with queries rapidly.  psql is part of the PostgreSQL
distribution; binaries and source code are available from <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/">http://www.postgresql.org/</a>.

<p>Unison is available to the public at host <code>unison-db.org</code>,
database <code>unison</code>, as user <code>PUBLIC</code>. No password is
required. (The default PostgreSQL port, <code>5432</code>, is used and is not
typically required.)  A typical session looks like this:

<pre class="code">
eg$ psql -h unison-db.org -U PUBLIC -d unison
Welcome to psql 8.0.3, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal.

Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
       \h for help with SQL commands
       \? for help with psql commands
       \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
       \q to quit

unison=>
</pre>

<p>From now on, I'll use assume you're already connected to Unison and will use
<code>unison=></code> as the prompt.
