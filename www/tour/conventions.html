<h2>Unison Conventions</h2>

Here are a few conventions and tips for new users:

<dl>

<dt><b>Be aware of table suffixes</b>
<dd>Unison views nearly always have a suffix.  We use <code>_v</code> for
views which we intend people to use directly and routinely.
<code>_cv</code> denotes a cannded view: a special view which defines
searches which appear in the <code>canned_views</code> table.
<code>_dv</code> indicates a "defining view"; such views are often
expensive and are used to periodically generate a materialized view
(really, a table) with a <code>_mv</code> suffix.

<dt><b>Specify <code>params_id</code> in queries whenever possible</b>
<dd>Most feature tables are indexed on pseq_id and params_id at the very
least.  Multicolumn indexes typically specify the params_id first, which
means that queries which don't provide a params_id will not use an index.
This also prevents users from seeing multiple similar results for distinct
runs.

<dt><b>Look at the run_history table</b>
<dd>If a query returns no results, there are two possibilities: the
program returned no output or the sequence was never run with these
parameters.  The only way to distinguish these cases is by consulting the
run_history table or run_history_v view.
