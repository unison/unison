<dt><b>Mining for Sequences Using Predifined Criteria</b>
<dd><a target="_blank" href="../cgi/browse_views.pl?cv_id=5"><code>http://unison-db.org/cgi/browse_views.pl?cv_id=5</code></a>
<br>Frequently used queries are stored as "canned views". This makes it
easy to bookmark dynamic queries, and this is the primary mechanism I use
to convey search results to others. In a near-future release, we will
permit restriction by species and sequence "age".

<dt><b>Mining for Sequences Using User Criteria</b>
<dd><a target="_blank" href="../cgi/search_sets.pl"><code>http://unison-db.org/cgi/search_sets.pl</code></a>
<br>This page integrates precomputed results from HMMs, PSSMs, and
Prospect threading for family-specific mining. The left side allows the
user to define sequence selection criteria. At the top is menu of curated
sequence sets. In the default example, sequences are selected using models
(i.e., HMMs, PSSMs, or PDBs) for TNF superfamily members, and "hits" are
categorized according to the specified curated set of
sequences.
