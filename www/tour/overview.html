<h2>Unison Tour Overview</h2>

A primary design goal for Unison is to make the data broadly available
from many calling environments.  Here are some examples of how <i>you</i>
may access Unison.


<p><b><u>As an end-user (<i>i.e.,</i> non-programmer)</u></b>

<dl>

<dt>Browsing via GUI database browser
<dd>There are many GUI-based database browsers available.  Unison should work
with any that support the native PostgreSQL protocol, ODBC, or JDBC.

<dt>Unison web interface.
<dd>The "official" Unison web interface is <a
href="http://unison-db.org/">http://unison-db.org/</a>.  Again, this is open
to all users.  Please see <a href="web.html">these examples of the web
interface</a> for some of the web page highlights.

</dl>



<p><b><u>As a programmer</u></b>

<dl>

<dt>direct connections to the database via command-line interactive terminal
<dd>Unison is based on <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>,
an excellent <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">OpenSource</a> database.
Read-only public access is available.  Please see the <a href="psql.html">psql
access instructions</a> for examples.

<dt>direct database access via a programmatic database interface
<dd>Unison may be accessed using any of the numerous database interfaces
available in Perl, Python, Java, Ruby, Mono, and other languages.  Please
familiarize yourself with the <a href="psql.html">psql access instructions</a>
to get started.  Native Pg, ODBC, and JDBC are available.

<dt>Unison Perl API
<dd>There is a beta-quality Perl API available.  We use it internally to load
data, but the API is still in flux.  The API is provided with the Unison code
download and documentation is included.

<dt>Programmatic generation of links to the Unison web interface.
<dd>Of course, users may wish to generate their own links to the Unison web
interface above.  We endeavor to provide a transparent link style which
facilitates this.  The above <a href="web.html">web highlights</a> includes
some sample links.
