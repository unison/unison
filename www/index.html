precomputed predictions for those sequences. Because results are precomputed and
integrated within one resource, it is possible formulate holistic queries

WHAT CAN I DO WITH UNISON?


<p>Unison aggregates protein sequences and sequence fragments from a
large number of databases. The intent is to contain a superset of all
available sequences.  After sequences are loaded, the most promising
sequences are identified based on origin, species, and other
properties. These sequences are subjected to an array of analyses whose
results are stored; results for other sequences will be loaded on request.

<p>The analyses currently include signal sequence and transmembrane
predictions, BLAST, HMM (Pfam) alignments, GPI anchoring, and others.
