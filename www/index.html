<h1>What is Unison?</h1>
Unison is an experiment in integrating a variety of protein sequence
information, primarily for the purpose of mining for novel members of
protein families.  

<p>Unison is unique in the breadth of sequence sources and types of
information available.  Sequences are stored non-redundantly and
precomputed analyses are "keyed" to those unique sequences (read: you'll
never analyze the same thing twice).  The analyses currently include
aggregate sequence properties, signal sequence and transmembrane
prediction, and alignments from structure based profiles and threading
(BLAST and HMM alignemnts are in the works.)  Because the analyses are
precomputed and stored in a SQL database, extremely powerful
hypothesis-driven queries are possible.

<p>Unison was originally created by Reece Hart.  It is now an active research
project and benefits enormously from the assistance of David Cavanaugh.

Unison is a work in progress and very incomplete.  Links on these pages
and the code behind them are unstable.  You've been warned.
