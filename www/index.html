<h1>What is Unison?</h1>
Unison is an experiment in integrating a variety of protein sequence
information, primarily for the purpose of mining for novel members of
protein families.  

<p>Unison is unique in the breadth of sequence sources and types of
information.  Sequences are stored non-redundantly and analyses are
"keyed" to those unique sequences (read: you'll never analyze the same
thing twice).  The precomputed analyses currently include aggregate
sequence properties, signal sequence and transmembrane prediction, and
alignments from structure based profiles and threading (BLAST and HMM
alignemnts are in the works.)  All of this is is available via SQL for
rapid and complex querying.

<p>
Unison was originally created by Reece Hart.  It is now an active research
project and benefits enormously from the assistance of David Cavanaugh.

Unison is a work in progress and very incomplete.  Links on these pages
and the code behind them are unstable.
